# How to use the data
All data are available in a tab-separated format, which can be easily imported to any commonly used statistical package. To save space, the datasets for each independent run (random seed) are combined into a zip-folder. A typical zip-folder contains the following datasets: 
- family
- indiv
- localities
- paramMap
- schools
- SEM

A detailed description of the variable in each dataset can be found in the freely-accessible [supplemental material](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/suppl/10.1080/19452829.2020.1850659/suppl_file/cjhd_a_1850659_sm6148.pdf) of our JDHC article](https://doi.org/10.1080/19452829.2020.1850659).
